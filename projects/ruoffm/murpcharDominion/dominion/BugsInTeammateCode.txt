Use of Random Tester found bug in the Smithy Function. There are cases that the players hand was not incremented properly.  With smithy the player should draw 3 cards, however there were certain cases that after playing smithy no cards where drawn leading the player to be minus 1. The majority of the test failures where when there was a player actions check and it returned less than 1. Which is strange in context of the tests since the game is initialed and the player is chosen so in they should have an action avaible at time of play. 

Use of Rnadom Testers also found a two bugs in adventurer. These tended to pop up when it was Player 0 being the player. There would be an incorrect return value in addition to the handcount not increasing properly when there was for sure  copper and silver in the deck to be found. When stepping through the code with GDB it appeared the cause was in certain cases, once again most of the time being when it is Player 0 turn the dominion and the dominion would either not register adventurer as an action card, or register that the player does not have enough actions and return a -1 value.
